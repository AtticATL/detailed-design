\section{Terminology}

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Static Design}
% Static: A structural diagram is provided that shows low-level components (classes, web pages, etc.) and their static relationships. Descriptions of functionality or attr/methods are shown. Appropriate syntax for standard diagrams, explanations for non-standard diagrams.

\subsection{Dynamic Design}
% Dynamic: A diagram is provided that shows runtime interactions of the static components. Appropriate diagram is chosen. Behavior illustrates how system will operate on a non-trivial use case.

\section{Data Storage}
% For database use: An ER diagram is provided. Relationships between tables and cardinality constraints are shown. Tables are appropriately normalized. PK/FK relationships are shown if needed.
% For file use: Format is documented if non-standard. Otherwise, a standard format is chosen.  
% For data exchange: Format is documented.


\section{Component Design}

See figure \ref{fig:example} for more details.
